# Suspicious Activity Recognition
Action Recognition Model to detect Suspicious activties through Surveillance videos

### Dataset used :
 https://www.kaggle.com/mateohervas/dcsass-dataset   
 Delete the second DCSASS Dataset folder and Labels folder

### Requirements :
  `python3`  
  `opencv3 (with ffmpeg)`  
  `keras`  
  `numpy`  
  `pandas`  

### Dataset Preprocessing :
  1. First extract the dataset folder to the same folder as the repository
  2. The `utils` folder contains 3 python scripts to run
  3. run `python utilties/resort_dataset.py`
  4. run `python utilties/create_normal_class.py`
  5. run `python utilties/preprocess.py`
  
### Training :
  The `train_set.ipynb` contains all functions needed to train model. Run all cells and adjust parameters in `main()` function for training.  
  For our experiment we used slowfast model with batch size `8`, img_size `224` and frames `25`.  
  Our slowfast model trained on above settings for `100` epochs can be found here https://www.mediafire.com/file/idn98l5m9rfcuvt/slowfast_finalmodel.hd5/file  
 
### Testing :
  1. First load model or use existing model after training.
  2. Run `predictions()` giving the video to predict as input. We have provided some sample videos in `test/`
